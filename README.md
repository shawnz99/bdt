## BDT
Binary data tool

This is my attempt to create a version of the unix command diff
with some features that diff may or may not have such as: 
  - Combining it with xxd
  - Coloring the different byte
  - Printing both files at once

## Usage/Installation

TODO:
  - Make the offset the offset byte not the offset line
  - Have it show more information
